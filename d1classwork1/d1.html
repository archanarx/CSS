   <h2 style="color:#00008b">₹3,999</h2>
   <p style="color:rgb(54, 47, 79); background-color:hsl(0, 39%, 68%);">A premium yet affordable wearable, the NoiseFit Halo brings a sleek metallic build and a round 1.43-inch AMOLED display (466×466 pixels) with Always-On mode. It supports Bluetooth calling (via Tru Sync), so you can directly accept or make calls from your wrist. For health and fitness, it includes SpO₂ monitoring, 24/7 heart rate tracking, sleep & stress tracking, and over 100 sports modes. It also offers more than 150 watch faces to customize the look.With its IP68 rating, the Halo is dust and water-resistant. Battery life is claimed to be up to 7 days under regular usage, though heavy usage (especially with Bluetooth calling) may reduce it significantly. Priced around ₹3,999 in India, it’s positioned as a strong value in the mid-budget smartwatch category.</p>
