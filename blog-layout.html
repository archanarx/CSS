    <h1>The Power of Consistency: Small Steps to Big Change</h1>
   
    <div>
        <h3>By Priya Malhotra</h3>
        <p>Consistency is often underrated in a world that praises instant results. We're drawn to stories of overnight success and viral fame, forgetting that behind most achievements lies a trail of small, consistent actions.Whether you're learning a new language, trying to build a fitness habit, or starting a blog—showing up every day matters more than how grand your efforts are. Five minutes of writing every day beats an hour once a month. Ten pushups daily outperform a two-hour workout that never happens again.Consistency builds momentum. It reduces resistance. It creates structure. But most importantly, it builds trust—not just with others, but with yourself. When you commit to showing up, you prove to yourself that you are reliable.So, the next time you feel discouraged by slow progress, remember this: small consistent steps may not be flashy, but they compound into something extraordinary over time.</p>
        <blockquote>Small efforts, repeated daily, create big results over time.</blockquote>
